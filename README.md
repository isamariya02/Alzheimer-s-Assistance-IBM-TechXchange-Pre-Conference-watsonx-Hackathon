# Alzheimer’s Assistant

## Overview

The Alzheimer’s AI Solution is designed to support Alzheimer’s patients and their caregivers by simplifying the management of daily activities and routines. Alzheimer's disease can lead to memory loss and confusion, making it difficult for patients to remember essential tasks, appointments, and medications. This AI-driven tool aims to empower patients to maintain a sense of independence while providing caregivers with a reliable means to assist and monitor their loved ones.

## Key Features

- *User Onboarding*: Caregivers or patients can enter essential details during the onboarding process, including:
  - Patient name and age
  - Severity of Alzheimer’s symptoms
  - Contact information for family members and healthcare providers
  - Medication schedules and routines

- *Interactive Chat Interface*: Patients can interact with the AI through a chat interface, asking questions like:
  - "What are my routines for the day?"
  - "What is the phone number of my son?"
  - "When do I take my medication?"

- *Task Management*: The AI can summarize daily activities and upcoming tasks, helping patients recall what they need to do and when.

## Future Scope

While the current implementation focuses on user onboarding and task retrieval, future enhancements may include:

- *Reminders and Notifications*: A system to send reminders for medication and other important tasks to help patients stay on track with their routines.

- *Voice Interaction*: Integration of voice features, allowing patients to interact with the AI using natural speech, making it even more accessible.
